                             HySure

What is it?
-----------

HySure is an algorithm to fuse hyperspectral remote sensing images with 
  either multispectral or panchromatic ones. This set of MATLAB files 
  implements the methods described in

       “Hyperspectral image superresolution: An edge-preserving convex 
        formulation,” IEEE Int. Conf. Image Processing, Paris, 2014.

       via subspace-based regularization,” IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens.,
       to be publised.
