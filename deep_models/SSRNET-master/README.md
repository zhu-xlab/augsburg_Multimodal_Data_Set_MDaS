We fetched the original codes of deep learning models from: https://github.com/hw2hwei/SSRNET

SSRNET for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion.
This is the code from 
> X. Zhang, W. Huang, Q. Wang, and X. Li, “SSR-NET: Spatial-Spectral Reconstruction Network for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion,”  IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (T-GRS), 2020.

main_ResTNet.py and main.py are the scripts to run the experiments using ResTNet and SSRNET respectively.
